# Training Loop Explanation

This document explains the training loop used for training a PyTorch model, focusing on the gradient calculation and parameter update steps.

## Training Loop

```python
for batch in train_loader:
    train_loss, train_acc = model.training_step(batch)
    # comet ml
    # experiment.log_metric("train_batch_loss", train_loss)
    # experiment.log_metric("train_batch_accuracy", train_acc)

    train_losses.append(train_loss)
    train_accs.append(train_acc)

    train_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Batch Retrieval:**
   ```python
   for batch in train_loader:
   ```
   - The loop iterates over batches of data provided by the `train_loader`.

2. **Model Training Step:**
   ```python
   train_loss, train_acc = model.training_step(batch)
   ```
   - The `training_step` method of the model is called with the current batch of data.
   - This method typically computes the model's predictions, calculates the loss, and optionally computes metrics like accuracy.

3. **Logging Metrics (Optional):**
   ```python
   # experiment.log_metric("train_batch_loss", train_loss)
   # experiment.log_metric("train_batch_accuracy", train_acc)
   ```
   - These lines, currently commented out, would log the batch loss and accuracy to an experiment tracking system like Comet ML.

4. **Accumulating Batch Losses and Accuracies:**
   ```python
   train_losses.append(train_loss)
   train_accs.append(train_acc)
   ```
   - The computed loss and accuracy for the batch are added to lists for later aggregation.

5. **Backpropagation:**
   ```python
   train_loss.backward()
   ```
   - The `backward()` method computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters.
   - This step uses automatic differentiation to propagate the loss backward through the network, calculating the gradient for each parameter.

6. **Optimizer Step:**
   ```python
   optimizer.step()
   ```
   - The optimizer updates the model parameters using the computed gradients.
   - It adjusts the parameters to minimize the loss based on its specific update rule (e.g., SGD, Adam, etc.).

7. **Zeroing Gradients:**
   ```python
   optimizer.zero_grad()
   ```
   - The gradients are reset to zero to ensure they don't accumulate across batches.
   - This is necessary because `backward()` adds gradients to the existing gradients.

### Understanding Gradient Calculation

#### Loss Computation
- When you call `train_loss.backward()`, PyTorch's autograd engine computes the gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter in the model that has `requires_grad=True`.

#### Gradient Storage
- These gradients are stored in the `.grad` attribute of each parameter.

#### Optimizer Step
- When you call `optimizer.step()`, the optimizer uses these stored gradients to update the parameters.
- The specific update rule depends on the optimizer being used.

#### Zeroing Gradients
- After the optimizer step, you call `optimizer.zero_grad()` to reset the gradients.
- This is crucial because gradients are accumulated by default, so without resetting, gradients from multiple batches would be added together, leading to incorrect updates.
- That meas if you do not zero out gradients after each step(the gradients are stores in .grad property of model parameters) in the next step old gradients are sum up to new gradients.This is not right

### Summary
The optimizer does not directly compute gradients or losses. Instead, it relies on the gradients computed and stored by the `backward()` call. The optimizer's role is to adjust the model parameters using these pre-computed gradients according to its specific update rule.

## Important Notes
- Always zero the gradients after each optimizer step to ensure correct gradient computation for each batch.
- Logging metrics can help track the training progress and diagnose issues.

This explanation should help you understand the key steps involved in the training loop and how gradient calculation and parameter updates work in PyTorch.
