You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab.\n",

We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",

        ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" or \"Edit > Clear Outputs\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."
