## Comet ML for PyTorch Experiment Tracking  ([https://www.comet.com/site/](https://www.comet.com/site/))

This project demonstrates using Comet ML for experiment tracking with a PyTorch model. Comet ML is a cloud-based platform that simplifies logging, visualization, and comparison of machine learning experiments.  

### Benefits of Using Comet ML:

* **Centralized Tracking:**  Track and visualize hyperparameters, metrics, models, and code in one place.
* **Collaboration:** Share experiments and insights easily with your team.
* **Experiment Comparison:**  Compare different runs to identify the best performing models.
* **Version Control:**  Track changes to your code and models over time.

### Usage

This example showcases logging hyperparameters and a PyTorch model with Comet ML.

**Requirements:**

* Install Comet ML: `pip install comet_ml`
* Create a free Comet ML account: [https://www.comet.com/signup](https://www.comet.com/signup)

**Instructions:**

1. Replace `KyMq7kTRAkOIPn7JQD33434fffdfdggQK` with your own Comet ML API key.
2. Update `model` and `train` functions with your specific model and training logic.

**Code:**

```python
from comet_ml import Experiment
from comet_ml.integration.pytorch import log_model

experiment = Experiment(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  project_name="general",
  workspace="wicky2001"
)

# Report multiple hyperparameters using a dictionary:
hyper_params = {
   "learning_rate": 0.5,
   "steps": 100000,
   "batch_size": 50,
}
experiment.log_parameters(hyper_params)

# Initialize and train your model
# model = TheModelClass()
# train(model)

# Seamlessly log your Pytorch model
log_model(experiment, model=model, model_name="TheModel")
```
